Monday's assessment will be War. The goal is to win ALL the cards, leaving your opponent with none. Game rules:
Players are each dealt half the deck in an alternating pattern.
Players each take their top card and lay it face UP.
If the cards' rank is the same i.e. 3 of clubs and 3 of hearts, players take ANOTHER card and lay it face DOWN, then repeat step 1.
If the last drawn cards are different ranks, all the cards drawn in this round are awarded to the drawer of the higher ranked card.
4. If either player runs out of cards at any time, that player loses and the game ends.
Further game rules are described on the Bicycle site: War rules, but the above is the limit of what you need to implement.
Advice
I'd like to stress the importance of being able to read error messages and debug your code quickly. The debugger is your friend!
One way to get really fast at this is to ask a friend to introduce some typos or delete/switch small random snippets of code and then sprint to fix them. Systematically approaching your errors and taking time to read and understand what the spec is asking, and how it is failing, will greatly benefit you.
